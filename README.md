How does it make it safer?

The main goal is not avoid having forgotten non freed pointers that were allocated, it helps that by storing every pointer in a list and at the end of a program freeing everypointer in that list.


An example of output for two lists, one with all freed pointers and the other with two unfreed pointers
```
[SUCCESS] POINTERS : All pointers where freed
[FAILURE] POINTERS : Unfreed pointer : pointer never freed
[FAILURE] POINTERS : Unfreed pointer : pointer2 never freed
```

## Usage

When allocating memory you can use `safe_malloc()` wich allocates memory for the struct you want while also adding the allocation in the list

When starting a program, you need to call `initialize_safer_pointers()` wich initializes the list correctly in the global variable `p_list* POINTER_LIST`

On exiting a program safely, you need to call `exit_safer_pointers()` wich will print all unfreed pointers and free them for you

When freeing memory, you can call `safe_free()` wich will remove the allocation from the list of allocations and free the node

For a working example, check the [test](test_safe_pointers.c)



## Utils

For using these helper functions, there are some parameters and utilies

### logging

You can choose to log errors such as malloc fails with the `LOG_ERRORS` definition in the `safe_pointers.h` file, you can also choose a std for the output of infos such as success on exiting in the `POINTER_INFO_STD` definition

### casting

when allocating a struct, you will have to use typecast to allow for autocompletion, the macro `SAFE_CAST` is there to help


## Doc


```c
int initialize_safer_pointers()
```
returns `POINTER_SUCCESS` or `POINTER_ERROR` if the program could not allocate memory using `malloc`
on success, it allocates the struct for the list and initializes it


```c
void exit_safer_pointers()
```
prints the unfreed pointers and safely frees them


```c
typedef struct node{
    void* p;
    char* name;
    struct node* next;
} p;
```

the struct used to contain a pointer, also a node in the pointer list,  it contains a `void* p` to the struct targeted by the allocation and a name to be printed when not freed properly

```c
p* safe_malloc(size_t size, char* name)
```
allocates a node (or 'p') and allocates the size given as parameter, the "p" parameter of the returned pointer points to an allocated memory of the given size. it also takes a name, that will be printed in case of unfreed node. on `malloc` error, it returns `POINTER_MALLOC_FAIL`

here is a working example of this function, more can be found [here](test_safe_pointers.c)

```c
typedef struct test_struct{
    int num;
    char* array;
} test;


p* _test_pointer1 = safe_malloc(sizeof(test), "_test_pointer1");
SAFE_CAST(_test_pointer1, test)->array = "test";
SAFE_CAST(_test_pointer1, test)->num = 4;
```


```c
int safe_free(p* pointer)
```
frees a node and the pointer it pointed to, also removes it from the list of pointers.
if the pointer is not valid, it returns `POINTER_INVALID_INPUT` else `POINTER_SUCCESS`, it can also return `POINTER_NOT_FOUND` if the user manually removed the pointer already

## Testing

When using valgrind, no leaks were detected with a semi complex test, you can also run the tests using the Makefile, `make test` to test the program for allcoating and freeing memory and `make leak` to test for unfreed memory with valgrind
